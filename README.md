# PathfindingVisualizer

This is my second project written for the "Object-oriented programming" course (pl. "Programowanie obiektowe") at AGH University of Science and Technology.
Application was designed to provide a simple visualization of the most popular algorithms for finding a path in a graph or plane.

## Features

- Resizable grid
- Ability to put up new walls with mouse click
- Generating random walls
- Generating a maze with a "recursive division" algorithm
- Multiple algorithms for finding a path
- Intuitive UI and animation of algorithm steps

## Requirements and usage

Program was written in Java 15 with JavaFX 15.0.1 and FXML. The easiest way to run this application is to use IntelliJ IDEA, download the source code and build with Gradle.
